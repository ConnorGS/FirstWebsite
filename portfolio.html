  <b><font color="#ffffff"><font size="+2">I used scratch to make 2 different games, each with a seperate style and way of play. The first game is a version of pong. In this version you fight against one of your friends to try to get the ball past the other side. I added a unique element which is the ball constantly getting faster after each hit until somebody scores or restarts the game. The other game I made is bossfight. As a wizard, you must dodge the eggs the bat throws at you. It uses a round system, with randomly selected phases that change each timme you restart. This game also has an ending where you beat the bat by getting to round 20. </b><br>

    <b><font color="#ffffff"><font size="+2">With this project, me and my group had to create an app using MIT App Inventor and choose what it did. Our group decided to make an app called neutrum, which was meant to even out the users emotions. We decided to use quotes to even out somebodies day, with negative quotes for people having a good day, neutral quotes for people having a normal day, and inspirational/good quotes for people having a bad day. You would press one of the 3 buttons based on the kind of day you were having and get a quote based on your choice. If we had more time I would also add a quiz that would use a series of questions to decide the kind of day you were having along with adding more quotes to each section, only having 8 quotes each. Overall while MIT App Inventor felt clunky at times, it was still easy to work with and provided a user friendly way to create our first app.</b><br>

    <b><font color="#ffffff"><font size="+2">In this project, me and my group had to create a chose your own adventure story, and we went a special route. Our choice was to make a story with only 1 happy ending. It was called unfortunate events and it was a choice story where only one set of choices would allow you to survive the night. We used the website repl.it and used define statements within define statements to call eachother based on user input. In the end there was more code in the define statements than code outside of define statements, allowing us a much easier time of setting it up. </b><br>

    <b><font color="#ffffff"><font size="+2">This project had me make a graph in python of something I wanted to learn more about and ask a question that the graph would answer. I asked the question of how rapidly Coronavirus cases were spreading in the us. The anser I got was that it was spreading at an even yet rapid pace.</b><br>

      <b><font color="#ffffff"><font size="+2">In this project I looked through the Wolf Sheep Predation simulation. I looked and looked for something to change to make it more interesting and found out that a way to do that would be to remove the walking stamina consumption of the wolves, allowing them to move as much as they want to get the sheeps. This ended up turning heavily in the wolves favor since they would win much more frequently than before, being able to survive being 1/4 of the sheeps starting population.
